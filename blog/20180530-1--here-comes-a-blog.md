# here comes a blog

Alright so as expected I didn't immediately turn blogging into a habit, but I did work on the site and the preliminary
plan. The plan is that there is no long term plan, and that if a homepage were to exist continuously it would do so in
forms I can probably not foresee. My corner of the web makes more sense as a collection of digital footprints that I
leave here and there.

I've chosen to write in Markdown because the format is usable without any software, and it is easily transformed into
a format that can be published to the web.
